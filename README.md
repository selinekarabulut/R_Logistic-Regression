The Effect of Prenatal Smoking and Mother’s Age on Gestational Age, Infant Deaths, and Premature Births
Maternal smoking during pregnancy and mother’s age are established risk factors for premature birth and sudden unexpected infant death. 
However, there is an on-going debate about the extent to which these associations are causal. It is difficult to determine whether these poor health outcomes are the result of prenatal smoking or are also attributable to characteristics of the mother which are correlated with prenatal smoking.
The aim of this study is to compare pregnancy outcomes among smoking and non-smoking young and older pregnant women. The data included information on 6851 (654 (9.5%) smokers and 6197 (90.4%) non-smokers) pregnant women, of which 4915 (72%) are young mothers and 1936 (28%) are older mothers.
Using chi-square tests to tease out the statistical differences and binary logistic regression analysis to examine the correlation between mother’s age and smoking, and gestational age and survival of babies, 
I find that mother’s age affects survival of babies and gestational age. Also the results indicate that mother’s smoking habit affects survival of babies and gestational age however, contrary to what previous studies suggest,
the effect is not statistically significant.
